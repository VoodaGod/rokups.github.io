## Sharing HID devices with KVM virtual machine

I run KVM virtual machines for various things. Occasional gaming is one of those things. After i assembled new intel-based build (sorry AMD, buldozzer just did not cut it =\) i noticed a critical difference from my AMD build. On Sabertooth 990FX R2 back panel had different sets of USB sockets handled by different USB controllers. What i did was pass-through one USB controller to VM and it gave exclusive access of several USB ports to VM. Pair that with KVM switch and i had easy way to flip between VM and host. With Gigabyte GA-X99-UD4 motherboard all usb slots on back panel belong to same USB controller. Other two USB controllers handle internal USB headers and what not. Now this is a problem. I do not want to take away PC case front USB ports from host and i surely can not reserve entire back panel for VM. Libvirt to the rescue! [Read More...](pages/kvm-hid.md)
